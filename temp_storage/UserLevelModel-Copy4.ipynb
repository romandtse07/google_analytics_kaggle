At 1000, the training runs for more iterations, but the gains are just as modest.  There is still the question of whether it is better to let the ensemble components overfit, but we might run into the problem we usually do with random forests.  At this rate, though, the system will do not much better than a small collection of independent decision trees.  We'll go ahead and try anyways."
